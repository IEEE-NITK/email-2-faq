## Overview
Emails have become essential information as businesses exchange enormous volumes of formal emails every day. The automatic creation of FAQs from email systems aids in identifying crucial information and may be helpful for future chatbots and intelligent email answering applications.

A few implementations use recently discovered deep learning techniques to retrieve FAQs from emails, even though there is research in the literature that concentrates on automatic FAQ development and automated email replying. With cutting-edge techniques, this solution seeks to make use of the unique framework F-Gen, an expert system that creates possible FAQs from emails.

We also aim to develop this product into a deployable service that companies and websites can use to generate FAQs from their thousands of emails. We also aim to use techniques such as sentiment analysis to generate automated feedback management and classification.

## Goals
1. A working model based on the F-Gen framework:
    - Query Classifier subsystem (QC subsystem)
    - FAQ Group Generator subsystem (FGG subsystem)
    - FAQ Generator subsystem (FG subsystem)
2. An expert system of F-Gen Email-2-FAQ with a low-level system design.
3. A web application to deploy the model.

## Prerequisites
- Python
- Pytorch (optional)
- Flask (for webdev only)
- HTML/CSS/Javascript (for webdev only)
- Deep Learning - basic concepts
- Git version control
- Object Oriented Programming (optional)

## Learning Objectives
- Pytorch framework.
- Object Oriented Programming in Python
- Basics of LSTMs and Convolution Neural Network
- Basics of Transformers and Attention Neural Networks
- Basic understanding and application of BERT-Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding embeddings
- Basic understanding and application of Siamese LSTMs
- Basic understanding and application of the BERT summarizer
- Model deployment and DevOps

## Expo Deliverables
1. Steps to train an E-Mail Dataset using the web application.
2. Showcase the generated FAQ examples based on the format below:

## Milestones
### Phase 0
- Phase 0.1 (2 weeks)
    - First 2 weeks would be the literature review phase and learning phase for Mentors.
- Phase 0.2 (2 weeks)
    - The next half of phase 0 is when Mentees start with their learning phase, and Mentors start working on the dataset featurization and QC subsystem.
### Phase 1
- Phase 1.1 (2 weeks)
    - Target would be to complete the QC subsystem and start working on the prototype for its system design in the first two weeks of this phase.
- Phase 1.2 (2 weeks)
    - Start working on the FGG subsystem and complete the system design work of the QC subsystem.
### Phase 2
- Phase 2.1 (2 weeks)
    - Target would be to complete the FGG subsystem and start working on the prototype for its system design in the first two weeks of this phase.
- Phase 2.2 (2 weeks)
    - Start working on the FG subsystem and complete the system design work of the FGG subsystem. Also start working on a Web application for the F-Gen system.

### Phase 3
- Phase 3.1 (2 weeks)
    - Target would be to complete the FG subsystem and prototype for its system design in the first two weeks of this phase. Also, continue work on the Web application for the F-Gen system.
- Phase 3.2 (2 weeks)
    - Benchmarking the model and test web deployment.

### Phase 4 (4 weeks)
- Buffer weeks for final testing, debugging, and Expo prep.
