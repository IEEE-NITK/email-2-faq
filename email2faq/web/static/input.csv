OK - 
Here's the demographics on the south Florida voter - 

They can play 10 
bingo cards at a time and not miss a number. 


They can juggle 53 numbers and pick 6 for the Florida Lotto, as 
well 
as select their Pick 3, Fantasy Five, and Mega Ball numbers. 
Why Palestenians throw rocks?

They can read 5 papers, 4 scratch sheets, and handicap 3 horses in 
the 
Tri-fecta at the horse race. 


They can spot a shanked golf ball in an acre of elephant grass 
300 
yards away. 


They can eyeball a non-resident in a 1,000-unit subdivision at 
200 
yds. 


They can report a scarred manatee at 10 fathoms to the 
Greenpeace 
hotline. 

They can take 37 different colored pills every 
morning and never mess 
it up. 

But they can't read a 4-line 
ballot both published in the newspaper AND 

mailed to them a week in advance and pick one candidate... 

You 
figure it out !!! 




Suddenly Florida makes Alabama and 
Mississippi look like geniuses.... 

? 

? 

""COME 
TO FLORIDA - The NEW Alabama......""

The DASH may need a legal risk rating attachment, and Gerald can draft that quickly if needed.  I hope it won't be needed, though, given that there is really nothing at risk....  Also, Dave Gorte may need to adjust it when he sees the DASH so I would begin by emailing a copy to him.  

Here they are:

The purpose of the account is to buy 0.5% of TGS shares.  By buying those 
shares, Enron will be able to utilize NOLs that are currently trapped in 
CIESA, the parent company of TGS.  Jeff Kinneman's group will handle actual 
market execution.  Glenn, please forward to Ted and Sara a  copy of the 
signed DASH.

Sara,

Ted Murphy has executed the documents relating to the opening of a brokerage 
account for EPCA @ Morgan Stanley.  Ted has asked that you send him an e:mail 
message as to the purpose of the EPCA brokerage account.

Thanks.

FYI. what are you upto? is everythimg ok? What are the different types of laptops available?
What are the specifications of each type of laptop?
What is the battery life of each laptop model?
What is the warranty period of the laptops?
What is the cost of each laptop model?
Can you tell me the battery life for laptops?
What are all the different types of laptop available?
What is average battery life of laptops?
What will be good specs for a gaming latop?
This is the bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts (recall 
that the argument to end DA by the Gov's finance folks, the bond folks, and 
Angelides, the Treasurer stems directly from this linkage).  


Though Hertzberg was initially a supporter, his legal consultant has been 
scared off by the Gov's people (i.e., to de-link would ""impair"" the 
contracts, triggering breach, liquidated damages and the end of Western 
Civilization as we know it).  The Senate ain't buying that line.

As a result, it's now a Senate play, but they need Republicans to get the 
2/3's necessary for passage, which ain't likely to be easy.  We urging Brulte 
to go along, but only  in exchange for deleting the ""no DA"" language in AB1X 
and for legislative language assuring that DA will continue.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: SB 18 (Burton) - Bonding


Attached, please find SB 18 (Burton) relating to bonds.  This is a regular
session bill with an urgency clause which means it requires a 2/3 vote.  The
bill language was formerly associated with ABX2 10 (Hertzberg).  The bill
could be heard by the Senate Energy Committee as early as today however as
of this moment it is still not on calendar.
