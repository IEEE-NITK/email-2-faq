### Summary
Extract FAQs from Emails to increase productivity.

### Overview
Emails have become essential information as businesses exchange enormous volumes of formal emails every day. The automatic creation of FAQs from email systems aids in identifying crucial information and may be helpful for future chatbots and intelligent email answering applications.

A few implementations use recently discovered deep learning techniques to retrieve FAQs from emails, even though there is research in the literature that concentrates on automatic FAQ development and automated email replying. With cutting-edge techniques, this solution seeks to make use of the unique framework F-Gen, an expert system that creates possible FAQs from emails.

We also aim to develop this product into a deployable service that companies and websites can use to generate FAQs from their thousands of emails. We also aim to use techniques such as sentiment analysis to generate automated feedback management and classification.
